            Extreme Commerce is Pakistan’s first EdTech start up with a sole
            focus on skills development and capacity building within the
            ecommerce and digital arena. Founded in 2017, it is the largest
            community of its kind in Pakistan, with well over 1 Million members
            to date and with over 150+ courses and income streams to choose
            from. We estimate that by 2025, our community will be generating
            well over $1 billion in inward remittance for Pakistan

        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p style="line-height: 2rem; font-weight: 400">
          Is two faceted, yet simple. First, generate and add $1 billion in
          service sector and ecommerce exports annually by 2025 by enabling and
          empowering the people with the right skills and professional
          trainings. Second, to make Pakistan the hub of international ecommerce
          - we want that whenever anyone around the world thinks of ecommerce,
          they think of Pakistan, making Pakistan a truly digital economy. We
          know our mission is ambitious, and we take pride in that because we
          have been able to fight the tide and prove that we at Extreme Commerce
          can think the unthinkable and deliver the impossible. In 2017, when
          Extreme Commerce was founded by Sunny Ali, we faced cut throat
          opposition, criticism and resistance, yet despite all of it we were
          able to pioneer within the ecommerce EdTech sector and changed the
          perceptions of the whole nation regarding starting an Amazon based
          business from Pakistan, paving the way for others to follow. During
          the first few years of our operations we focused on business
          automation and wealth creation through Amazon FBA (Fulfilled by
          Amazon) model. However, keeping our vision in mind we have added
          multiple international ecommerce and digital skills development
          opportunities to our platform.

            From humble beginnings in the slums of Karachi to becoming a
            multimillionaire, Sunny Ali is on a mission to transform the digital
            landscape of Pakistan through digital skills, personal development
            and capacity building. His vision is to empower the people of
            Pakistan to achieve self-sufficiency through ecommerce and digital
            skills, especially through Amazon’s FBA (Fulfilment by Amazon)
            model. Sunny Ali is the first person to truly push the envelope of
            international ecommerce in Pakistan, making him an expert and the
            pioneer in this field. He has spent the 4 years taking this very
            mission door to door in Pakistan and has now successfully raised a
            community of enthusiasts that are ready to bring about a great Lorem

          After seeing the massive opportunity that Pakistanis were missing on,
          Sunny Ali founded Extreme Commerce back in 2017 and has since served
          as the CEO of Extreme Commerce in United States, United Kingdom,
          Malaysia and Pakistan. He aims to translate his experience that he has
          gained over the last two decades and after three bankruptcies, into a
          digital learning and enablement/capacity building platform that is
          Extreme Commerce. Through this EdTech start up, Sunny Ali is
          transforming lives through local and global ecommerce, digital and
          technology start-ups. His ultimate vision is to enable 100,000 people
          to create $1 billion in service sector and ecommerce exports for
          Pakistan by 2025, a vision that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has
          recently acknowledged in their latest report. Sunny Ali through
          Extreme Commerce is focused on breaking the vicious cycle of ‘kitchen
          money’, and the employee mindset that is so engrained into our
          society, by actually enabling people to create wealth by leveraging
          business automation through Amazon FBA and furthermore by gaining
          digital skills that are on the rise globally. To really cement and
          further this vision, Sunny Ali has personally invested over $3 million
          in Extreme Commerce and is now broadening the parameters of eCommerce
          in Pakistan by compiling and delivering state of the art trainings so
          that the nation of Pakistan has access to every global ecommerce
          opportunity, not just Amazon. Simply put, Sunny Ali is a man of action
          and delivers what he promises. He has committed to give free access to
          the Extreme Commerce VBC (Video Bootcamp) platform, normally $180, to
          all college and university students, underprivileged, and the women of
          this great nation in a bid to really boost the mission of a
          self-sufficient Pakistan. And all of this comes down to one mission
          which is to make Pakistan the hub of E-commerce service outsourcing,
          where Pakistan will be known as the fulcrum of E-commerce in the
          digital platform, around the globe.
